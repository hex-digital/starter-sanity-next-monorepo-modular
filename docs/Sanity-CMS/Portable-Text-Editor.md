# Portable Editor

Within some Modular Content Blocks, and on some Page Templates, there is a Portable Text Editor.

This editor gives content editors flexibility on editorial content. It is most useful on text-based pages, such as Blogs or Press releases, where the section-based Modular Content Blocks aren't as appropriate.

The Portable Editor can add and format text, like a WYSIWYG, but doesn't necessarily represent the output visuals 1:1. It's more like a structured content creator, where the input is stored and retrieved as objects, and so can be queried and manipulated with code.

The Portable Editor can also add certain Blocks between that content, that have been created for the Portable Editor.
