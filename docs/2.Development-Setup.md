# Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Setup environment variables in both the web app and the Sanity studio app (`apps/web/.env` and `apps/sanity/.env`)
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Start the development server for the web app at `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm dev
```

5. In a new terminal window, start the development server for the Sanity studio `http://localhost:3333`:

```bash
cd apps/sanity
pnpm dev
```

## Production

You can build either application for production using the `build` command from `apps/web` or `apps/sanity`:

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm run build
```
