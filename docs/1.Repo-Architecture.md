# Repo Architecture

## Apps and Packages

The repo is split into Apps and Packages.

Apps are thought of as the standalone applications that are deployed, in this case the Web Application and the CMS Studio.

Packages are then used to share code across applications. Typically, if code could be used in another application, we would want to put it in a package, even if we haven't got a second application for it yet.

Examples of packages include configuration, utilities, types, UI components, core functionality, etc.

## Dependency Management

Dependencies must all be kept up-to-date to use the same version across the packages.

This is most easily achieved by maintaining a list of all dependencies required in each app, in the `apps/*` directories, and then listing these as `peerDependencies` within the packages themselves.

This ensures the package used is always the one defined in the `app`, and prevents duplicate instances of packages being used in an application, due to version mismatches.

Running `pnpm deps:check` in the root of the repository will highlight any cases where dependencies are mismatched across the application, allowing for easier updating.
